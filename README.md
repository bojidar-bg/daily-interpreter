# "Daily" interpreter

A programming language and a series of articles inspired by [Aras's "Daily Pathtracer" series](http://aras-p.info/blog/2018/03/28/Daily-Pathtracer-Part-0-Intro/).

## Running the code

Dependencies (build):
* meson and ninja
* gcc, clang, or another C compiler (untested)

Use `meson bin` to generate the initial build files. Then `cd bin/` run `ninja` to compile the project. Finally, run `./daily` to run the code.

## Devlog
